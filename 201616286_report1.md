# Final Project Report1 -  2016-16286 Lee Hae Dong
## What I Did
- I used one more ECU, So totally 2 ECUs are used.
- First ECU executes 3 tasks LK, CC and SENSING. 
- Second ECU executes remaining tasks. 
- Increased target speed to 110km/h. 
- As the speed increased, reduced the steering angle and period of LK and SENSING. 

## Why I Did
- My first assumption is that if I want to decrease the lap time, I need to increase the target speed through CC. And when I increase the target speed, my simulation car started hitting the fence. Because when the handle is turned at that same angle, car more rotates in the high speed than in the low speed. 
- So I started to decrease the steering value. At the same time, I decreased the period of LK and SENSING. In order not to hit the fence, It is important to detect the curve and turn quickly. For this, period for both of LK and SENSING should be short. 
- other tasks such as BRAKE, LOCAL do nothing. So I split them from LK and SENSING to minimize period of LK and SENSING. CC also needs value from SENSING, but if it is not in the same ECU with SENSING, It is not easy to adjust the scheduling for them. So I just execute CC in the same ECU with SENSING. 
- I set minimum value 20 for the execution time. first ECU executes 3 tasks, So Theoretical minimum hyper period may be 60s. But I set 100s for the period of each tasks considering the read and write overhead. 
- When I proceeded to this point, I confirmed the lap time of about 50 seconds. 
- The limitation of the lap time seemed to be only 30 seconds, and even if the speed was increased, the stability in operation fastly decreased, but the speed improvement was not great, So I set the target speed 110 km/h
