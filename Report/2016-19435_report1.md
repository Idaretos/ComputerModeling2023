First, I increased the target speed in CC.cpp file. To get a better track record, a faster target speed is needed.
After increasing the speed, the car started to wobble around, because the period between each lane keeping action was too long.
So, I reduced the LK period of the system. Shorter period means the car steers to the center more frequently, and adjusts its track more frequently.
Also, I reduced the amount of steer every time LK action is taken, which is in LK.cpp, so as to reduce the wobble every time car changes track.
I reduced it from 10000 to 5000.
To reduce the lap time even further, I reduced the LK period further, but after some point, since if the period is below 100, utilization needs to be more than 50.
It caused the deadline miss, so I decided to add another ECU just for LK SWC.
The original ECU, I connected CC, BRAKES, LOCAL, SENSING, POWER SWC all and named it ECU1. For the new ECU, I named it ECU0 and only connected LK SWC to it.
I reduced the LK period the the lowest possible, which is 40, and the execution time for that would be 20.
For the ECU1, I reduced BRAKES, LOCAL, SENSING, POWER SWCs to each 300 period and 30 execution time, so that they meet the utilization >= 10 limit. 
For CC, I decreased the period as lowest as possible so as to not cause deadline miss, which led to deadline of 150 and execution time of 30.
With these conditions, I increased the target speed and reached 120km/h. Beyond 120km/h, the car started to wobble too much and crashed too often.
Finally I got the best track record of 52.5 seconds.
