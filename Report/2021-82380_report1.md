# Task 1 Report

## Approach
To decrease the lap time, the speed of the car obviously has to be increased, but to keep the car on the track with a higher speed, the periods and deadlines of all the jobs have to be decreased, which increases the amount of times these jobs get executed. By decreasing the deadlines, of course we also need to decrease the execution times.

In the design of the simulation, I kept every the same ratios execution times between all of the jobs. Meaning that CC and LK have half of the execution time of the other jobs, and the other jobs have an execution time of period/5, which makes sure that the deadline gets met.

## The Values Used
I increased the speed to the maximum speed of 80km/h, and to keep the car on the track with double the speed, at least twice as many jobs have to be executed, so I lowered the period and deadline to 250. 

With these values, the car got around the track, but it was swaying a lot across the left lane, so to reduce this, I lowered the steering value from 10000 to 6000, which made the car sway way less in its lane.

## The Results
My final result on the E-Track 5 was 1:17:13.

In my first tests, I tested the simulation on "A-Speedway", because I didn't notice we had to change the track, and got 2:49 on the reference setup. This is the performance mentioned in the slides, but when I noticed that I had to use "E-Track 5", I tested the reference and got 2:24, which is quite a lot faster than what the slides mentioned.

When I tested my final setup on the "A-Speedway", I got a performance of 1:29:18, which is 80 seconds lower than the reference, but I now wonder if this performance will be counter for the grading (as it corresponds to the valuees in the slides), or if the performance of "E-Track 5" will be counted, which has a different baseline than what's mentioned in the slides.   
Either way, my results are more than 70 seconds under that baseline, but I just wanted to mention that there might have been a mistake here.

### Disclaimer
If you want to run the simulation, you'll need to change the names of the CC and LK files as I didn't rename the CC and LK files in design.xml to the versions with my student ID in them.
