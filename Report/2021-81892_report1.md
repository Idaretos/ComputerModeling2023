Final report 1: Write down what you did and why you did it to get a higher speed from the baseline.

First, I started my experimentation with the settings that were given to us in the assignment. So I started out with a period of 500 and execution times of 50 for LK and CC and 100 for the other files. Then, I noticed that BRAKE, LOCAL and POWER did not have code in there cpp files, so I tried setting the execution times of these to 0. This as I expected did not affect the car, so I left the settings for these three variables at 0 for the rest of my experiment. 
Then, I tried changing the values for the execution times of CC and LK in the design.xml file. One first ground rule that I found is that the execution times added together have to be smaller or equal to the period, if not a deadline miss will occur. Also, I found that by increasing CC and decreasing LK the car becomes more a bit faster. This is because CC represents the speed keeping and LK the lane keeping. So if lane keeping is done less accurately, the speed will go up, since less curves are computed. If the speed of the car rises by a lot and CC is much bigger than LK, then this can cause the car to not be able to keep up with lane keeping anymore, so that it starts zigzagging and at worst crashes against the wall. If LK is bigger than CC, then the speed of the car is a decreases a bit. This is because in this case more time is allocated to lane keeping, so the car is now more sensitive to curves and will not correct up to target speed as fast, since the execution time of CC is shorter.

Next, I started changing the target speed in the CC.cpp file. First, I updated it from 40 km/h to 50 km/h. Updating the target speed like this makes the car more unstable. It starts zigzagging, if it cannot lane keep in time. In order to run the car well at 50 km/h I decreased the period, so that the frequency of the lane-keeping function and the speed-keeping function will be increased. It can be noticed, that if the period is decreased too much, i.e. the car is working without zigzagging at a higher period, but we decreased it even more, then this will affect the time performance of the car. If however, the period is too high, then the car will zigzag and not keep up with lane keeping. At 50km/h the parameters that worked were period=300 and LK execution time = 20, CC execution time = 180 and SENSING execution time = 100. At a target speed of 60 km/h the parameters that worked were period=200, LK exec time = 30, CC exec time = 100 and SENSING exec time = 70. 

I skipped a target speed of 70km/h and adjusted it to 80km/h in the next step. First, I tried running it with just adjusting parameters and it ran okay, with not too much zigzagging with a period of 140, LK exec time = 50, CC exec time = 40, SENSING exec time = 50. This ran at 1:16:98. However, if this is executed more than one round, it starts to become unstable. So, I decided to look into the LK.cpp file. There I changed the conditions for lane keeping. I adjusted them down, so that at smaller conditions, the tires would turn and when they turned that they would not turn as abruptly, but at a lesser angle. In this way the car became more stable and my execution time was at about 1:16:40 with best time 1:10:00.
