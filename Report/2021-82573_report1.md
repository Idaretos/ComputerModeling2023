## Changes explanation
We want to achieve two objectives for the car:
* Finish the race faster
* Don't hit a wall

For the first objective, I began by doing the simplest change I could think of which is **doubling the speed** (by removing the -40,000.0)  
The car effectively reached 80km/h but it was hitting the wall every time  
<br/>
I noticed that the car didn't drive in a straight line and was instead very "shaky" and took a long time to correct its trajectory. At very high values for the design.xml, it would even drive backwards  
This is why I **decreased these values** in order to make the car more "responsive" because each task would be done faster, thus constantly readjusting the trajectory  
This proved to reduce the range of each change of direction and made it so the car took longer to hit a wall  
<br/>
As it was not enough and I couldn't reduce the values of the design.xml (to avoid _deadline miss_), I **reduced the steering values**, so it wouldn't "shake" as much and keep being on the road  
<br/>
The car was then able to complete all 3 laps without hitting a wall and faster than with the initial values
