# Final project part 2: Implement logging functions for two cases - Marguerite Indrayani SHETTY - 2021-82006

## Case 1: Implement a log of the car movement related tasks (LK, CC)

### Purpose
We want to implement a log of the car movement related tasks in order to understand its behavior (for example, if it does not move).

### Job.cpp: call of the logging function
In run_function(), the code reads the data of tagged_data_read and writes the data to delayed_data_write.
Therefore, the logging function needs to be called each time it reads or writes data, according to the task name since the data read
or written is different.

### CC.cpp and LK.cpp
1. The data read by CC.cpp is as described below:
    CC_Recv_ACCEL_VALUE     --> read1
    CC_Recv_TARGET_SPEED    --> read2
    CC_Recv_SPEED           --> read3
    CC_Recv_CC_TRIGGER      --> read4

    and it writes the data as below:
    CC_Send_BRAKE           <-- write5
    CC_Send_ACCEL           <-- write6

2. The data read by LK.cpp is as described below:
    rtU->read1              --> read
    rtU->read2              --> read

    and it writes the data as below:
    rtY->write3             <-- rtDW->w3
    rtY->write4             <-- rtDW->w4

    rtDW is for the autostorage, rtU for the external inputs and rtY for the external outputs.

### TaggedData.cpp and EthernetClient.cpp
1. The data that can be found in TaggedData.cpp is as follows:
    data_time, data_read1, data_read2, data_read3, data_read4, data_read5 and data_read6.
2. Then it is put inside a buffer[24] in EthernetClient.cpp as follows with 4 bytes for each element and in hexadecimal values:
    [CC_Recv_CC_TRIGGER
    data_read2
    CC_Recv_SPEED
    data_read1
    CC_Recv_TARGET_SPEED
    CC_Recv_ACCEL_VALUE]

### DelayedData.cpp and EthernetClient.cpp
1. The data that can be found in Task.cpp is as follows:
    data_time, data_write1, data_write2, data_write3 and data_write4.
2. Then it is put inside a buffer[16] in Task.cpp as follows with 4 bytes for each element and in hexadecimal values:
    [data_write1
    data_write2
    data_write3
    data_write4]

### Initialization of the log file
The log file is initialized in Logger::set_schedule_log_info(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Task>>& task_vector) to print its header.

### Implementation of the logging function
There are four cases:
1. Task name is CC and it is a "READ"

2. Task name is CC and it is a "WRITE"

3. Task name is LK and it is a "READ"

4. Task name is LK and it is a "WRITE"

### Elements still needed to be implemented
- Cases 1. + 3. : length and raw data read
- Cases 2. + 4. : calling the global object "delayed_data_write" without any segmentation fault and printing the time, the length and
the raw data written.


## Case 2: Implement an event log of the real cyber system

### Purpose
We want to implement a log of the car movement related tasks in order to understand its behavior (for example, if it does not move).

### Executor.cpp: call of the logging function
In Executor::run_simulation(JobVectorOfSimulator& job_vector_of_simulator, JobVectorsForEachECU& job_vectors_for_each_ECU, double start_time),
the code runs a job for the simulation: it releases it, then starts it and ends it.
The logging function is called 4 times, according to whether the job has been released, has started, has finished before its deadline or has missed it.
"run_job->set_is_simulated(true)" indicates that the job simulation ended.

### Initialization of the log file
The log file is initialized in Logger::set_schedule_log_info(std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Task>>& task_vector) to print its header.

### Elements still needed to be implemented
- "FINISHED" does not seem to be printed in the log file, as if the code never entered the condition "utils::real_workload = true".
- The condition for "FINISHED (DEADLINE MISS)" could be implemented in the logging function by using a global variable, like in Logger::start_logging().
