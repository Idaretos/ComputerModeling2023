# Issues
First of all, I would like to mention that this assignment was the source of numerous issues software-wise. After the first installation and changing settings in /etc, My computer wouldn't start anymore (my computer runs on the manjaro linux distribution). Even after reinstalling manjaro and settting up a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu, I had trouble setting everything up and although the application did work for some time it then stopped for no apparent reason, but I probably have done something wrong. I tried to reinstall the whole project but this did not work. As a result I was not able to go as far as I would have liked in the project, but still did the first part.

# Changes
## CC.cpp
I decided to try to double the speed as a first try. The car was quicker but hit the walls.
## LK.cpp
My next course of action was to change the steering value to 1000 to have smoother inputs.
## design.xml 
I changed the values of design.xml because I wanted to fine-tune the decision process and allow the car to do more actions per minute. Thus, I reduced all of the values while adjusting exec time. This leaves us with periods at 200 and exec time of 15 for CC and LK, and 30 for the rest.

# Results
My results were about 1'18 per lap.
