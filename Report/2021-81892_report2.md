Final report 2: Write down where you put logger functions and why for case #1 and #2.

Case #1:
For case #1 I first called the tagged_data_read global object and use the variables from this object to make the log data for "READ" variables. For "WRITE" variables I tried to call the delayed_data_write global object in the same way, however this did not yield any results, therefore I included the 4 "WRITE" variables into the logging function parameter. In the Job.cpp, I added the logger function in the run_function(). I added it once after the tagged_data_read is initialized as current_data, since afterwards the tagged_data_read is cleared. Then I added the logger function after the delayed_data is initialized, since this is were the write variables are initialized as well. Lower down in the function tagged_data_read is initialized to current_data as well (this is mutually exclusive from the first initialization, since it is in an else if statement) and the data in tagged_data_read is cleared afterwards, so I added a logger here as well. Similarly, afterwards in another else if statment delayed data is also defined, and the "WRITE" variables are initialized, so I added another logging function there.

Case #2:
The logger function itself was relatively simple to write for task 2, since all the values that are printed into the log file are given as parameters. In the Executor.cpp I added the logger function multiple times in the run_simulation function. First, I added it after the statement "DEADLINE MISS IN REAL CYBER SYSTEM" is printed out, since I figured that the jobs that print out this statement have missed the deadline. Here I gave as input string "FINISHED (DEADLINE MISS)". Then in two separate if statements, the simulated_release_time is set, so I followed those statements with my logging function to log "RELEASED". Further down in the code there is a part where the actual start time, along with other parameters is logged in schedule_data. I put another log function with string parameter "STARTED" here. This code is followed with code where schedule_data logs the finish time. I put another log function under this to track the "FINISHED" jobs. 
Unfortunately, I could not test case #2 because whenever I called the logger function in Executor.cpp I would get an error when building the program. This is why, I have commented out the mentions of the logger function in Executor.cpp. I am not sure why the build error happened to me, but it seemed to not recognized the function with the set of parameters I gave. I cross-checked everything in Logger.cpp and Logger.h, but could unfortunately not detect any differences in definition and use.
