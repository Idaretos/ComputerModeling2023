# Final project part 1: Make the car as fast as possible - Marguerite Indrayani SHETTY - 2021-82006

## Baseline
The car's speed is 40km/h with the following parameters and it completes 1 lap in 2min and 24s:

Period CC               500
Execution time CC       50
Period LK               500
Execution time LK       50
Period SENSING          500
Execution time SENSING  100

Target speed            40km/h
Full steering value     10000.0


## Constraints
Period in [20,500]
Execution time >= 20
If period (250,500], min(Utilization) = 10
If period (100,250], min(Utilization) = 20
If period (0,100], min(Utilization) = 50
Utilization = ?????

## Parameters
Since the files of BRAKE, POWER and LOCAL do not read or write any value,
the tasks do not need to be executed so their execution time is set to 0.

The tasks used in the system are described as below:
- CC: writes the acceleration value and brake value according to the current speed, the target speed of the car and the trigger value
- LK: writes the steering value for the right and left wheels according to the full steering value
- SENSING: only reads values such as current speed, target speed, acceleration and trigger value

A first intuition is to increase the target speed to make the car faster. However, the tasks do not check often enough the
car's current speed to make the acceleration or brake accurate.  As a result, the car's trajectory is not stable and does not follow
the shape of the road.

When modifying the parameters, it was noticeable that if the total execution time of the three tasks
was higher than 300 (with all periods set to 500) then there would be a "DEADLINE MISS IN REAL CYBER SYSTEM".

The priority of the tasks (length of the period) should be as follows:
1. LK
2. SENSING
3. CC
in order to have the car follow more often the shape of the road, then update all its values, and finally increase or decrease its speed.

The execution time of each task should also respect the constraints mentioned above.
Since 20 is the minimum of execution time, we can set LK execution time to this value and fix its period at 200.
We should also lower the period of SENSING to 300 in order to make it more important than CC. Its execution time should also be a bit decreased
like 80 for example.


## Results
With the following parameters, the car's speed is around 80km/h and it completes 1 lap in 1 min and 15 sec:
Period CC               200
Execution time CC       20
Period LK               500
Execution time LK       50
Period SENSING          300
Execution time SENSING  800

Target speed            80km/h
Full steering value     3000.0
