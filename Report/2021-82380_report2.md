# Task 2 Report

## Case #1
For the logger function of case 1, I added 2 parameters, namely one to pass the tagged data (read) and one to pass the delayed data (write) to the logging function.  
In the Job.cpp file I call the function in the `run_function()` method as that is where the data is being read and written. Depending on if data is read or written, either a `TaggedData` or a `DelayedData` object is passed to the logging function and the other parameter is null.

The logging function itself will write the data to the log file in the right format. The `std::setw()` function is used to set the width of the columns in the log file, `std::left()` is used to set the text alignment to left, and `std::hex` is used to change the decimal numbers into hex format.

In the constructor of the Logger, before any data is being written to the log file, the header is written to the file.

## Case #2
For this case, the layout of the log file is done similar to the first case by writing the header to the file in the constructor of Logger and by using `std::setw()` and `std::left()` in the logging function.

In Executor.cpp, the logging is done in the `run_simulation()` method. The "FINISHED (DEADLINE MISS)" case is logged whenever a deadline miss occurs (and this is logged to the console). The "RELEASED" case is logged whenever `job->set_is_released(true)` is called. The "STARTED" case is logged after `run_job->set_simulated_start_time()` is called. And finally, the "FINISHED" case is called when `run_job->set_is_simulated(true)` is called (which is called when the job is finished).

The jobs have both "simulated" and "actual" time values, from the specification, I didn't know which of the two to log, but I chose to log the "actual" time.
